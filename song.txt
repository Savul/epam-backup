Could it be the little things you do to me 
Like waking up aside you it’s so new to me 
Life can be so full of danger 
In the dark there lurks a stranger 
I just can’t imagine what he wants with me 
When I’m with you it’s paradise 
No place on Earth would be so nice 
Through the crystal waterfall 
I hear you call 
Just take my hand it’s paradise 
You kiss me once 
I kiss you twice 
As I gaze into your eyes 
I realize it’s paradise
