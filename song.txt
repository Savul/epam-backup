Could it be the little things you do to me 
Like waking up aside you it’s so new to me 
Life can be so full of danger 
In the dark there lurks a stranger 
I just can’t imagine what he wants with me 
When I’m with you it’s paradise 
No place on Earth would be so nice 
Through the crystal waterfall 
I hear you call 
Just take my hand it’s paradise 
You kiss me once 
I kiss you twice 
As I gaze into your eyes 
I realize it’s paradise
It’s right out of something from a fairy tale Terribly exciting and a scary tale It’s nothing I could ever make up Am I dreaming? Will I wake up Just to find out this is to be reality When I’m with you it’s paradise No place on Earth will be so nice Through the crystal waterfall I hear you call Just take my hand it’s paradise You kiss me once I kiss you twice As I gaze into your eyes I realize it’s paradise Just take my hand it’s paradise You kiss me once I kiss you twice As I gaze into your eyes I realize it’s paradise As I gaze into your eyes I realize it’s paradise

new song
1) Madonna — Frozen.
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You’re frozen
When your heart’s not open
You’re so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You’re broken
When your heart’s not open
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we’d never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
Now there’s no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same

If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You’re frozen
When your heart’s not open
